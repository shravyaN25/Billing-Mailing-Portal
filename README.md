# üè°üèòÔ∏èAnnapurna Badavane Association - Billing Portal

## About

The Annapurna Badavane Association Billing Portal is a full-stack web application designed to automate and streamline the monthly maintenance fee collection process for the Annapurna Badavane residential colony. This application replaces the traditional manual bill writing and distribution system with a modern, efficient digital solution.

> *Note:* Since this codebase contains sensitive information about residents of Annapurna Badavane colony, the repository and deployment link are private and only accessible to authorized administrators.



## Purpose

Prior to this application, the colony administration faced significant challenges:

- Manual creation of maintenance bills was time-consuming (3+ days per month)
- Tracking payments and maintaining records was error-prone
- Distributing physical bills to all residents was logistically difficult
- Lack of transparency in financial reporting created trust issues


This application solves these real-world problems by providing a centralized system for resident management, automated bill generation, and digital distribution, significantly reducing administrative overhead while improving collection rates and financial transparency.
